Installation
============
When developing or contributing to vpc-router it is helpful to install some
useful packages for running local unit tests. You can do so with this command:

    $ pip install -r requirements/develop.txt


Testing
=======
To run all unit tests, use the `run_tests.sh` script, like so:

    $ ./run_tests.sh

This also creates code coverage reports in HTML, which are by default stored in
`/tmp/vpc-router-coverage`.

To just run specific tests, use (for example):

    $ python -m unittest tests.test_utils

All unit tests are contained in the `tests/` directory.


Use the `style_test.sh` script to check for some common pep8 conditions and
code complexity.

    $ ./style_test.sh
